// Note that IDA already had a built-in swift demangler, but it was becoming difficult to maintain.
// The long-term goal of this plugin is to fully deprecate IDA's custom swift demangler
// in favor of libSwiftDemangle.
//
// However, the new approach still hasn't been fully integrated into IDA,
// so there may be times when IDA's old swift demangler produces more
// desirable results.
//
// Set this option to NO if you prefer the names generated by the old swift demangler.
