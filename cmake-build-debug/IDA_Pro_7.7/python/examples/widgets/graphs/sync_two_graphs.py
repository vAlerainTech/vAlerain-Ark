summary: follow the movements of a disassembly graph, in another.

description:
  Since it is possible to be notified of movements that happen
  take place in a widget, it's possible to "replay" those
  movements in another.

  In this case, "IDA View-B" (will be opened if necessary) will
  show the same contents as "IDA View-A", slightly zoomed out.
