summary: triggering bits of code by pressing a shortcut

description:
  `ida_kernwin.add_hotkey` is a simpler, but much less flexible
  alternative to `ida_kernwin.register_action` (though it does
  use the same mechanism under the hood.)

  It's particularly useful during prototyping, but note that the
  actions that are created cannot be inserted in menus, toolbars
  or cannot provide a custom `ida_kernwin.action_handler_t.update`
  callback.
